## üìöSolana Program
As we are slowly moving with the Lectures and Tasks, and you already have some experience with Solana Programming we think that it is time to try to create something on your own !! The most important task for you is to implement the final dApp as the result of the School of Solana. Within this task, you should utilize all your prior experience, as well as all the knowledge you've gained in this course. Lastly, feel free to implement whatever comes to your mind, it may result in a truly great idea!

However, this is not the end. We have prepared many great lectures until the end of the school, so no worries. This does not mean that the School of Solana is already coming to an end!


### Task details
This Task consists of two parts:
1. **Core of your dApp**
    - deployed Solana program
2. **Frontend**
    - Simple Frontend in order to interact with the dApp


### Requirements
- An Anchor program using a PDA deployed on **Devnet** (obviously **Mainnet** also possible).
- At least one TypeScript **Test** for each Anchor program instruction. These tests should cover both the happy path and the unhappy path scenarios (unhappy = tests that intentionally trigger errors).
- A simple **Frontend** deployed using your preferred provider (for more info, check below).
- A **Readme.md** file with:
    - A brief **Description of your project**, explaining how it works and its purpose.
    - If you have successfully deployed the Anchor program and the frontend, provide a **Link** where we can view the results.
    - Instructions on **How to build and test** your Anchor program locally.
    - Instructions on **How to run the frontend** app locally (this is optional for those who deploy frontend).

### Ideas
Even though below you can find a lot of great projects and ideas. It is highly recommended to start with something simple. Best is to sit down and think about it for a bit and then work on the project in iterations. Do not try to implement everything at once!!
- **Social app**
    - Twitter,
    - Instagram,
    - Giphy,
    - Friendtech,
    - Spotify
- **Blog**
- **Voting** - [D21 - Janeƒçek method](https://www.ih21.org/en/guidelines)
- **DeFi**
    - Crowdfunding
    - Raffles
    - Escrow
    - Tipping
    - Lending ([Solend Documentation](https://docs.solend.fi/)),
    - Liquid Staking ([Marinade Documentation](https://docs.marinade.finance/)),
    - data query with Pyth ([Pyth Documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds)),
    - AMM ([Raydium Documentation](https://raydium.gitbook.io/raydium/))
- **Gaming**
    - Browser Game ([Gaming on Solana](https://solanacookbook.com/gaming/nfts-in-games.html#nfts-in-games)),

### Deadline
The deadline for this task is **Wednesday, May 29th, 2024 23:59 UTC**.

### Submission
Within this repository, you can find two folders: one meant for the Anchor project, and the second meant for the frontend. Feel free to update this structure if you need to. But please if you make any significant changes to the structure, comment it sufficiently in the Readme.


### Evaluation
Evaluation process is based on the **Requirements**. That means if you meet the requirements you pass the Task.

### Example Workflow
Let\`s say you are going to implement the Twitter dApp as the Solana Program. The steps could be:

**1.** Implement Twitter dApp using the Anchor Framework.

**2.** Test the Twitter dApp using the Anchor Framework.

**3.** Deploy the Twitter dApp on the Solana Devnet.

**4.** Using the Solana Scaffold template, implement Frontend for the Twitter dApp.

**5.** If you find problems within your dApp return to **2.**

**6.** Publish Frontend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

**7.** Describe dApp within the Readme (Frontend + Anchor project)

**8.** Submit the Twitter dApp using GitHub Classroom.

This is an example workflow, feel free to use your own preferences !!
